## Intro

A group project with classmates utilizing Google Map, Twitter, NY Times, and Yelp API's. The basic concept of the app is to allow users to go on quests and help them explore the city and try out new things. Rather than having to plan out everything when you visit a new city, you can use the app and let the quests guide you. Already lived in the city for many years? Use the app to explore parts of the city you haven't been to before. This app is still a work in progress. NOTE: You need to generate your own api keys to use this app.
